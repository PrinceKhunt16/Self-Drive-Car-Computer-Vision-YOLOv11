## **About the Project**

This project centers on developing three key computer vision models for autonomous driving: **Road Detection**, **Lane Segmentation**, and **Steering Angle Prediction**. The models are designed to work in tandem to help a self-driving car understand its surroundings and make decisions in real-time.

### **Kaggle Notebooks:**
For more in-depth details, the models were trained and tested in the following Kaggle notebooks:

- [YOLOv11 Road Lane Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/princekhunt19/yolov11-road-lane-segmentation)
- [YOLOv11 Object Detection for Road Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/princekhunt19/yolov11-object-detection-road-visualization)
